To read with your gray eyes
From: Gustavo Adolfo BÃ©cquer

To read with your gray eyes,
To sing them with your clear voice,
To fill your chest with emotion,
I did my verses myself.

To find in your chest asylum
And give them youth, life, warmth,
Three things that I can not give,
I did my verses myself.

To make you enjoy my joy,
For you to suffer with my pain,
So that you feel throbbing my life,
I did my verses myself.
